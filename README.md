## Hints

Although all current occurring fields are mapped there is no guarantee
additional fields will appear without warning. If this is the case please
open an issue stating the exception stacktrace and the response logged while having `setLogJsonResponse(true)` in `IrDataClient`.


Always be aware that not all fields in a DTO are filled. Some DTO's are
used as subtypes more than one other DTO on different detail grade. Do ` null` checks when using DTO field content.
